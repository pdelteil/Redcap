# Redcap
Redcap related development: plug-ins, scripts, etc. 

**Export_Large_Projects.php:** Plug-in that allow users to export project's data successfully. The problem that we faced many times was that the export process would take hours and exported an empty file. The plug-in solves this problem doing a batch export. It works with 2 user privileges Full Data export and de-identifiable export privileges (data_export_tool= 1 OR  data_export_tool =2)
